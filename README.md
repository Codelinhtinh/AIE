# Project Name
üåüImage Object Detectionüåü

## Description
This is a FastAPI-based web service that accepts an image upload and performs object detection on the image using a pre-trained model Yolov5m. It returns the annotated image with the detected objects.

## Configuration
You can modify the configuration parameters of the model by updating the CFG class in the configs.py file. The available configuration options are:

**image_size**: The size of the input image for prediction.

**conf_thres**: The confidence threshold for object detection.

**iou_thres**: The IoU (Intersection over Union) threshold for non-maximum suppression.

Feel free to adjust these parameters according to your requirements.
